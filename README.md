# Simple workflows releaser

## Description

The Github actions automatically makes release basing on change of release-version
(Thechnilly it's better then PRs cause most of a times I work alone on projects)

So, idea here it is to just simply take python executables and place its on correct folder, and
build js static to dist bundle and paste it into release bundle as well.

## TODO

1. Maybe at some point i'm gonna add testing for js and python and allow/disallow releasing basing on test summary
